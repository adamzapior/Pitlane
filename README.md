# Pitlane

**Simple Formula 1 stats tracker created with UIKit.** This project was my playground for experimenting with UI development and making sure these interfaces are not just visually appealing but also accessible to all users. I implemented variable cell height in UITableViewCell and support for moving words with a dash in places where the size using devices does not allow the words to be displayed on one line. 

**A Dive into DTO:** Another key aspect of this project was to get my hands around Data Transfer Objects (DTO). I used the free Ergast API as a data source and mapped its model to my application's model within the repository. The Pitlane app might have just a few screens, but my goal was to try out DTO firsthand. I wanted to see how it could help in separating the app's business logic from the API it relies on.

**What I've Learned:** Although Pitlane is a small-scale project, it's been a great opportunity to explore UIKit in depth and understand the practicality of using DTOs in real-world scenarios. It's been a fun and insightful journey into the world of iOS development, and I'm thrilled to share it with you.
